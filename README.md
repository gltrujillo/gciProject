## PROJECT INFO
Our final deliverable in response to our grand challenge is a website prototype that is able to take in voices
and write out formatted notes on what is being said. It can receive vocal input through files or real-time speech
by the user. In later versions, it should be able to create more sophisticated notes that can be used in class for
lectures.
It should be noted that this repo does not include API keys for privacy reasons and that these files are a skeleton
of the finished code.

## ERRORS
N/A
Website transcribes to console successfully when used with API keys.
